Generate a password list from target information
## What does Santas List do?
It creates a dictionary for a dictionary attack using personal information the attacker has about the target

Santas List has powerful letter-replacing. For example it turns the name "Mike" into "mIkE", "M!Kâ‚¬", "m1K3", etc.
## Who is this for?
This program is for security researchers needing a powerful and reliable way to create dictionaries to crack password hashes
## What features are still to come?
Better performance, more questions, more permutations and much more!


### Personal comments
This is my first bigger programming project. It is also the first time I'm using a proper IDE as well as Git and Github so forgive me for mistakes that will inevitably happen. I'm working on the project as much as I can and will keep working on it until there are no more features to add.
